    <p>
        This installation consists of ice on a rotating platform, controlled by a ToF distance sensor, and buttons
        programmed with an Arduino in a 3D-printed housing that allows interaction with a p5.js sketch.
        Our intention was to create an interactive installation that allows users to create collective art together but
        has the irony of making it on an ephemeral and transparent object, which will eventually melt away.
        As a viewer approaches from a distance, the ice continuously rotates, generating reflections of colors in the
        environment and distorting the projected image. However, the ice stops when the sensor detects a viewer in
        front, allowing for a clearer understanding of the projected image.

        This project was a collaboration with Ella.
